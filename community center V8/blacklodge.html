        <h2>When do we meet?:</h2><p>We meet every Odd numbered friday <br> We are at the black cabin just past the cow farm!</p>
        <p>Hello, welcome to the homepage of The Black Lodge, <br>we are the worlds biggest haters of the white lodge.<br>
        We despise them because they are too nice to everyone and have no <br>backbone, they cannot say "no"<br> and they are
    weak nerds. here at the black lodge we are the real deal. <br> we have no problem stealing when we need to, taking money from people
scamming,<br> robbing and comitting crimes. We know how to party as well! <br>Come join us at the black lodge if you like to have fun and <br>
throw rocks at people who go to the white lodge<br> We are having our first meeting soon where we will be learning how to create chaos. </p></div>
